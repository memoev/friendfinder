## Code Overview :deciduous_tree:

The most import piece of code on this repository resides on the `apiRoutes.js` file. A express post method which handles all routes inside the program, including the block of code that calculates compatibility:
  
```javascript
app.post("/api/friends", function (req, res) {
    console.log(friends);
    var selectedFriend = friends[0];
    var biggestScore = 100;
    
    for (i = 0; i < friends.length; i++) {
        let totalDifference = 0;
        for (j = 0; j < friends[i].scores.length; j++) {
            totalDifference += Math.abs(parseInt(req.body.scores[j]) - friends[i].scores[j]);
        }
        console.log(totalDifference);
        if (totalDifference <= biggestScore) {
            biggestScore = totalDifference;
            selectedFriend = friends[i];
        }
    }
    friends.push(req.body)
    res.json(selectedFriend);
});
```
